### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was one of my favorites because I've always been curious on how to code.
    I think the process was simplified the most it could be while still allowing us
    to do a sufficient amount on our own. It was a fun lab that made me feel satisfied 
    when I saw the hello world text print on screen having. This provided a good
    understanding of std::cout.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was a great lab! Using the if and else statments to create the HiLo
    game was a very fun experience and was the first time I felt like I made a fun
    program. At the time it was tedious to complete but looking back it was necessary
    excercise for if/else proficiency. It was my favorite of the earlier labs.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2 was probaly my favorite lab. Determining whether a number is prime was
    a simple yet intricate lab that felt rewarding upon completion. I was pleased to see
    the different applications of most of what we had covered at the time show up in a
    single lab. I was able to mix while statements with modulo as well as bool functions.
    It was a lab where I felt like I had actually learned a lot since the beginning of the
    semester.
